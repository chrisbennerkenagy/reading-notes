# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow

Control flow in programming refers to the order in which statements are executed. It governs how a program's execution proceeds based on conditions, loops, and branching structures. Control flow allows developers to make decisions, repeat actions, and create more complex behaviors in code by determining the sequence of executed statements.

## JavaScript Function

A JavaScript function is a reusable block of code that accomplishes a specific task. Functions encapsulate a series of instructions under a single name, making code modular and organized. They accept inputs (arguments), process data, and can optionally return results. Functions are a foundational concept in programming, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Invoking or Calling a Function

Invoking or calling a function means executing the code within its block. To call a function, use its name followed by parentheses (). Arguments, if needed, are placed within the parentheses. Calling a function triggers the execution of the function's statements and can yield a return value if applicable.

## Parentheses () in Function Definition

In a function definition, parentheses are used to indicate the parameters a function accepts. Parameters act as placeholders for values passed to the function when called. For instance:

```javascript
function multiply(x, y) 
{
    return x * y;
}
