# Reflection 03: *Revisions and the Cloud*

## Quick Impressions

> Overall, I found this subject to be extremely fun. Using GIT, to update and change my Github profile was effective and fun. I found it extremely easy to toy around with, and in doing so got a lot more comfortable with it.

## Rundown:

Version control is a system that allows users to track and access changes to files throughout their existence. There are three main types of Version control systems; localized, centralized, and distributed.

GIT is a distributed version control system. It is used to track changes to a source code. Using git cloning you are able to create a local file of your github repository. This not only allows you to work on the file before uploading it, it also takes a snapshot of all changes to the file that you make. Allowing the user to go back to any iteration of the file, as well as create a documentation system for all changes that are made along the way. 

As you work, the file is stored in three ways; modified, committed, and staged. In order to take your changes and create a snapshot, you must first ‘add’, then ‘commit’, and finally ‘push’ the file to (in this case) Github.
