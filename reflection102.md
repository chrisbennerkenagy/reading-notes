# Coders Computer Review

#### Notes on work space 
> Software dev requires the ability to work with text and other sources of input to create new projects. One is required to write text and manipulate files in order to achieve the result that they want. In order to do this in the best way; it is important to have the right tools. 

> Simply one can use a text editor to write the code that is needed for the program. Different text editors will provide more functions and features that can help the user visualize and edit in real time. There is no right text editor, rather it is most important to find the one that works best for the user. Another option is to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is a tool, like a text editor - that provides help while writing the code. However, it also can contain more comprehensive tools to compile, debug, and run programs. This can be incredibly helpful to work in an all inclusive environment. 

> Another needed tool is the ability to access all areas of your work space. In Linux, this can be done by using a command center to access and manipulate all files. This is particularly easy as everything in Linux is categorized as a file. Knowing this, the user can use basic syntax in user commands to move, manipulate, and create files.
