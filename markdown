# Markdown a Whats What

#### Quick Look
> Markdown is a wonderfully approachable language that allows users to format plain text files that can be accessed almost universally. This allows for the creator to make any text from websites to emails to look the way they intended when accessed from virtually any application. This makes Markdown a very efficient and practical tool.

Now that we know, what Markdown is (a Markup language) and why we use it (efficiency and universality) let's figure out how to use it:

#### The Basics

Markup uses symbols or syntax to denote what format the accompanied text should take on. For example when creating a header, all one needs to do is add a number symbol (#) in front of the text. Sizing the header is as easy as adding more number signs to decrease the size. 

##### Syntax Examples

Emphasis:

For italicizing a word, simply place an asterisk before and after the word or phrase. In order to emphasize a word by making it bold, you place two asterisks before and after. It's important to note that underscores also work in the same principle, however Markdown readers interpret underscores differently and because of this its best practice to use asterisks. 

Lists:

To create an unordered bulleted list, place either an asterisk, a plus, or a minus symbol in front of a word or phrase. Continuing to do so for every other element in the list with line breaks separating all elements. 

Links:

The quickest way to create a hyperlink is to encapsulate the website or email address in angel brackets. However if you want to create a title for a link, simply put the title inside brackets followed by the link in parenthesis. Additionally you can have a phrase or a title appear when the mouse highlights the link by adding the phrase in quotation marks following the url inside the parentheses.
