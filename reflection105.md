>CSS is clearly a powerful tool that allows web pages to be interactive and fun, >instead of lifeless documents. You can add CSS by inserting these instructions >three ways; External, Internal, and Inline. In practice, using an External CSS >stylesheet is best practice.

## A quick example CSS syntax

*How to give all paragraph elements red text*

```
P
{
   Color: red;
}
```

This syntax can be added Internally or Externally. To place Internally, place within your style tag at the beginning of your document inside of the head section. Or, for best practice create an External CSS style sheet and add the above tag to the document.
