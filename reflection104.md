# Reflection 04: *Structure web pages with HTML:*

*What is HTML and why do we use it?*
> HTML or HyperText Markup Language, is a powerful and common markup language used to display documents in web browser. It is used to give structure to your web page, giving the needed definitions all of the pages content, such as headers, paragraphs, images, and the like.

## *Elements inside HTML*

> Everything in HTML is made up of elements. It is in essence comprised of the segment content one is compiling with the syntax used to communicate how it is structured and compiled. This syntax surronds the content. So the element is comprised of an opening tag (syntax), the content, and finally the closing tag (syntax).
>
>Elements can contain extra information that is not displayed in the actual content by attaching attributes to the element.
>
>Semantic elements are what give the content structure. These are commands that placed in the tags which wraps the content and gives it meaning.
