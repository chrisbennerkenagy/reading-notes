# Reflection 06: Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## What are variables in JavaScript?

Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manage data values. They act as containers that hold different types of information, such as numbers, strings, objects, and more. Variables allow you to give a name to a piece of data, making it easier to work with and manipulate that data throughout your code.

## Declare a variable and Assignment?

Declaring a variable in JavaScript means creating a new variable and assigning a name to it. This is done using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword, followed by the chosen variable name. Once the variable is declared, use the ('=') oerator to assign a value to it. For example:

```javascript
let age; 
age = 32;
```

## User Input

**What is information received from the user called?**

Information received from the user is commonly referred to as "user input." User input refers to any data or information that a user provides to a program or application. This input can come from various sources, such as keyboard input, mouse actions, form submissions, or any other interaction with the user interface.

JavaScript can capture user input using various methods, such as the prompt() function for simple text input or event listeners for more complex interactions.
